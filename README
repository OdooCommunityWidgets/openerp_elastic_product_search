This module hooks OpenERP into ElasticSearch.  It hooks into some of
the objects and when they are created or modified, sends their data
to ElasticSearch to be indexed.  

It also provides a menu option on the Settings->Configuration->Scheduler 
menu to perform a full reindex of the data.

The indexes created have the name 'openerp_$dbname'.  

The models hooked into the search are,

    product.product - name, description, description_sale

By default the ElasticSearch is assumed to be listening on 127.0.0.1:9200.  
If you want to change where it tries to connect to add an elasticsearch
configuration parameter to the openerp-server.conf

    [options]
    elasticsearch = 192.168.0.99:9200
